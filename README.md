# [ICCP 2020] FoveaCam: A MEMS Mirror-Enabled Foveating Camera
This is a reference implementation of the control algorithm implemented in our paper "FoveaCam: A MEMS Mirror-Enabled Foveating Camera", which was published in the 2020 International Conference on Computational Photography. The code shows a simulation of a MEMS mirror tracking targets based on our control derivatives from the paper. If you find our code useful, please cite:

# Install
1. install numpy
2. install matplotlib
3. git clone <link>
4. python main.py

The simulation should then begin.
