# [ICCP 2020] FoveaCam: A MEMS Mirror-enabled Foveating Camera
This is a reference implementation of the control algorithm implemented in our paper "FoveaCam: A MEMS Mirror-enabled Foveating Camera", which was published in the 2020 International Conference on Computational Photography. The code shows a simulation that controls a MEMS mirror to track targets based on our control derivatives from the paper. If you find our code useful, please cite:
